        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Oatmeal is a preparation of oats that have been de-husked, steamed, and flattened, 
            <br>or a coarse flour of hulled oat grains that have either been milled or steel-cut. 
            <br>Ground oats are also called white oats. Steel-cut oats are known as coarse 
            <br>oatmeal, Irish oatmeal, or pinhead oats.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (such as Quaker Oats Old-Fashioned Rolled
                    <br> Oats)</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
