    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Focaccia is a flat leavened oven-baked Italian bread, similar in style and texture to pizza; in some places, it is called pizza bianca. 
        <p>Focaccia can be served as a side dish or as sandwich bread and it can be round, rectangular, or square shape.</p> </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 sprig rosemary</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast first:</li>
            <li>Add the water:</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to stir the two together.</li>
            <li>Slick the dough with olive oil:</li>
            <li>Slick the surface of the dough with olive oil; then cover the bowl. 
                <br>Stick the bowl in the fridge immediately;<br>
                leave it there to rise for 12 to 18 hours (or longer
                <br>—I’ve left it there for as long as three days).</li>
            <li>Deflate the dough and transfer to a prepared pan. I love this 9×13-inch USA pan. <br>If you don’t have one you can use two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or something similar. <br> If you are using glass baking dishes be sure to grease the dishes with butter before pouring a tablespoon of olive oil into each. <br>(The butter will ensure the bread doesn’t stick.) Don’t touch the dough again for 2 to 4 hours depending on your environment.</li>
            <li>it’s time to dimple it! You can use simply olive oil and salt — I recommend good, flaky sea salt for this.<br>Note, the dough in the photo below spent three days in the fridge, and the dough was super bubbly!</li>
            <li>if you are using rosemary, sprinkle it over the dough. Then pour two tablespoons of olive oil <br>over the dough, and using your fingers, <br>press straight down to create deep dimples. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt — again, something like Maldon is great here.</br></li>
            <li>Transfer to oven immediately and bake at 425ºF for 25 minutes or until golden all around. Remove focaccia from<br>pans and place on cooling racks.</li>
